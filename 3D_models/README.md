This 3D model is still at a concept stage and is designed around a printer with a 250x250 sized bed.
In other words; the model is intended to be split into 4 equally sized sections.

And "reinforcement_parts.stl" acts as a screw-together support using M4 bolts. Pro tip: use some kind of adhesive, watertight glue inderneat the reinforcement parts!

Note that it works on a 3 wheel basis and you need to print 1 pcs of frontwheel, 2 pcs backwheels.

Typical print settings:
PETG, ABS or Nylon
5 walls, 5 top and bottom layers
50-75% infill (e.g. adaptive cubic or similar strong infill)
